# etch-a-sketchTOP
JavaScript project from "The Odin Project" Fundamentals course.

The 3rd project of the "JavaScript Basics" portion of the Foundations pathway from "The Odin Project".

In this project, I will be creating a browser version of a sketchpad/etch-a-sketch. Using various DOM manipulation skills learned throughout this portion of the course.

This will be accomplished with a variety of JS and CSS methods, some of which will be learned through self study as this project progresses, along with knowledge gained from the previous sections of the course pathway.
